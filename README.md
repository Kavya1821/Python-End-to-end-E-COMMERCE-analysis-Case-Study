# Python-End-to-end-E-COMMERCE-analysis-Case-Study

This project is an end-to-end case study on E-commerce analytics. It involves the analysis of data from an e-commerce platform to derive meaningful insights and inform business decisions. The primary goals of the project are to understand customer behavior, product performance, and overall business health.

#### Key Steps Involved:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**:
   - Load various datasets: Customers, Orders, Order Items, Order Payments, Order Reviews, Products, Sellers, and Geo Locations.
   - Perform data cleaning and preprocessing, such as handling missing values and converting data types.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyze customer data to understand demographics and purchasing behavior.
   - Examine order data to track order processing and delivery times.
   - Review product data to identify best-selling products and categories.
   - Evaluate seller performance and geographical distribution of orders.

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Use libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to create visualizations for better understanding and presentation of data insights.

4. **Key Metrics Calculation**:
   - Calculate key metrics such as Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV), Monthly Active Users (MAU), and Revenue per User (RPU).

5. **Predictive Modeling**:
   - Develop models to predict future sales, customer churn, and other business-critical metrics.

### Potential Questions and Answers:

1. **Q: What datasets were used in this project?**
   - **A:** The datasets used are Customers, Orders, Order Items, Order Payments, Order Reviews, Products, Sellers, and Geo Locations.

2. **Q: How were missing values handled in the data?**
   - **A:** Missing values were handled by either filling them with appropriate values (e.g., mean, median) or by dropping rows/columns with a significant amount of missing data.

3. **Q: What libraries were used for data visualization?**
   - **A:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly were used for data visualization.

4. **Q: How was the Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) calculated?**
   - **A:** CLTV was calculated based on the average purchase value, purchase frequency, and the customer lifespan.

5. **Q: What insights were gained from the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)?**
   - **A:** Insights included customer demographics, purchasing patterns, product performance, delivery times, and seller performance.

6. **Q: How was the data prepared for modeling?**
   - **A:** The data was cleaned, relevant features were selected, and it was transformed into the appropriate format for modeling. This included encoding categorical variables and normalizing numerical features.

7. **Q: What predictive models were developed?**
   - **A:** Predictive models included sales forecasting models, customer churn prediction models, and models to predict other key business metrics.

8. **Q: How were the results of the predictive models evaluated?**
   - **A:** The results were evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), depending on the type of model.
